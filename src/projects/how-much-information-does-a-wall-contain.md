description: We could say that the architecture we live in is, in a way, predictable. It behaves like a paternal figure, wanting to overprotect the user by leaving no space for the unknown; no room for real interaction. We just need to take a look at an average floor plan and, even without the furniture being drawn in, we can guess the function of every space of the house. Against this predictability, how could we construct in a way that goes beyond aesthetic and functionality? A system that once is out there, you can’t fully control it but inhabit it.

description: The Center of the Border is an experiment on personal borders. As a part of a bigger project about borders, it deals with the issue through the materialization of an abstract individual space, which is the actual personal border. The border presents itself more as a filter than a limit, flowing with the person but changing irregularly his/her perception of reality. This filter is made by particulars, prejudices and experiences.

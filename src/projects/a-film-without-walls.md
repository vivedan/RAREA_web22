description: This piece is part of the project ‘How much information does a wall contain?’. Both pieces are opposites and at the same time they complement each other. While on one hand we were building a wall, on the other hand, in the film we were removing walls from the screen/sets. By removing them, we intend to complement the questions that arise from the wall, involving the spectator actively to find out the value of the missing information in each scene.

The idea of the film emerges from the inhabitants you can find through the pages of the thesis ‘The bigger Picture’. They inhabit systems, spaces and they have their own voice. They are the starting point for reflections on how we can inhabit systems that we haven’t even created.

description: Inhabiting is a “violent” action of transformation and transfer of character into a structure. In this piece, rather than analysing the inhabitant vs. the house, the exploration is directed towards the contained vs. the container, being the first provided by the human character and the later by the architectural body. As a visitor, you can explore how the character distributes and affects the different intimacy layers in a space.

Nowadays, with devices such as Alexa or Google Home, we can “talk” with the house. But, from a speculative perspective, what would happen if we wouldn’t need such “mediators” to communicate with the house, and what if instead of doing superficial things such as turning on/off lights, you could really play/transform the concept of space, as an extension of our body. Maybe that could even be the only way we understand our body. 

This work tests some concepts of non-linearity in storytelling as a way of constructing the story based on exploration (position relevant) rather than decision-making (time/character relevant), similar to the concept of flexibility in architecture. In this case, it was important to experiment with the “limitation” of a tv screen. The interaction is introduced using a video game controller to control and discover the identity within the body, exploring different layers. This aspect helped us to test the limit between a video game and a film through the relationship between visuals, controller and storytelling.

description: "The virtual intervention of this exercise aims to complement a museum historical object in a non-destructive way, augmenting its value through a better accesibility to the context. Taking as an example the stone structure of a gothic window, we aimed to recreate the mood around the original object by means of the light that it created in the past."

The AR app on a handheld device should mask the rest of the room, as if letting just a layer of reality (the gothic window) inside the virtual sphere (the atmosphere) where the light of the tainted glass exists. The light should evolve during the day, generating an ever changing virtual atmosphere (maybe even linked to the weather outside?), making every visit to the museum unique. All this together leads to an evaluation of the power of the context when facing reality. What surrounding makes the object feel more real: the virtual atmosphere or the curated room of a museum?

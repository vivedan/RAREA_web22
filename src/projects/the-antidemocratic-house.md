description: “A line that delimits nothing, that describes no contour, that no longer goes from one point to another but instead passes between points, that is always declining the horizontal and the vertical and deviating from the diagonal, that is constantly changing direction, a mutant line of this kind that is without outside or inside, form or background, beginning or end and that is alive as a continuous variation. Such a line is truly an abstract line and describes a smooth space.” A thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari.

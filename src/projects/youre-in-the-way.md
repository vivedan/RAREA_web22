I took the package from the hands of that woman, who explained to me, with mixed feelings, the predilection of all her siblings for that painting (it was obviously a painting, based on the shape of the package)."

This project reflects the different levels of “noise” - social, visual, audible - that appear together as a result of the uncontrolled expansion of mass tourism. This project features three 3D-printed models taking the form of specific architectural artifacts e.g. Corinthian capital. Projected on the models, from above, are the visual details of the artifacts providing an extra dimension of color and texture which draws viewers closer to the models. The audio that is emitted from the pieces are a verbal narrative describing the actual locations where the artifacts are found. As multiple viewers come closer to inspect the models and listen to the verbal descriptions, a new layer of audio begins to overlap. The new layer gradually obstructs the verbal layer with the “sounds of overtourism.” As viewers begin to become overwhelmed by this noise pollution and leave the noise begins to fall away again revealing the verbal narrative underneath.

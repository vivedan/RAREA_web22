description: "Monuments in architecture are constructions related to a high concept of respect, which is mostly understood through preservation and protection. But is this really respect?\n What does it mean to respect a building?\n
What does it mean to be a monument in architecture?\n
Is it possible that architectural monuments are cancelling the life of their buildings?"

"Respect comes next to freedom and free agency. It means to accept the
way it is, including virtues and defaults. Respect should be the basis of
coexistence. It is what allows different ways of thinking, with the only limit
that these ways of living and acting do not end up being an oppression
for another being. It is an attitude towards qualities from a positive
perspective."

These definitions were given by different people from my surroundings
thinking that they were talking about human beings but the answers can
easily be translated into other beings or objects and they are still valid.
After all, architecture comes from humansâ€™ minds, therefore it is consistent
to think that buildings are gifted with humanity. What if we should treat
buildings as beings? Or even further, as human beings?
